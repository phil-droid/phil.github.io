      <p>The 3D maze game built with SDL2, C++, and raycasting technique is an immersive and challenging gaming
        experience. The game combines advanced graphics rendering, intricate game logic, and an engaging maze
        exploration concept</p>
      <p>The graphics of the game are brought to life through the powerful SDL2 library, which provides a robust
        framework for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. Using raycasting, a technique that simulates 3D environments by
        projecting 2D rays into a virtual space, the game creates a realistic sense of depth and perspective. The maze
        walls and objects are rendered with textures and shading, adding visual detail and enhancing the immersive
        atmosphere.</p>

      <p>The Maze Project was inspired by our shared passion for gaming and the desire to create an immersive and
        challenging gaming experience. The project allowed us to apply our skills in graphics rendering, game logic,
        and maze exploration.</p>
    <p>As students at Holberton School, this project serves as a portfolio project to showcase our abilities and
      knowledge in game development. We have spent considerable time and effort to design and implement the Maze
      Project to deliver an engaging and visually appealing gaming experience.</p>
